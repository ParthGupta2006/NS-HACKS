    <h1>ALL NOTES AT A SINGLE PLACE</h1>
    <p>
      Want to know the best method to remember what your teacher has said in
      class or what you’ve read in a book?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it’s note-taking! You've probably tried it many times during
      your studies. However, it's unlikely that your notes will be very helpful
      if they are inaccurate, badly structured, and ill-organized.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help you, we’ve developed a 100% free online notes tool. It can quickly
      provide study notes according to your requirements. Try our tool and give
      your memory a significant boost!

      <li><h2>BENEFITS OF OUR NOTES</h2></li>
      <p>Our notes are a fantastic study tool with many advantages:</p>

      <li><h2>WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE STUDY NOTES</h2></li>
      <p>
        Research shows that note-taking is one of the core elements of the study
        process. There are many reasons for that. Here are the most prominent
        ones:
      </p>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Taking notes will significantly improve your ability to recall and
        comprehend information.
      </li>
      <li>
        You’ll be able to better reflect on the things you hear during lectures.
      </li>
      <li>You’ll pay more attention to the lecture’s contents.</li>
      <li>
        Making connections between topics will come more naturally to you.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>STUDY NOTES: TAKING METHODS</h2></li>
      <p>
        Taking notes by simply transferring information on paper is good, but
        sometimes it won’t do. What if your teacher is talking too fast or using
        unfamiliar terms? For these and other reasons, researchers have
        developed unique methods of note-taking. Let’s review them and analyze
        their advantages and disadvantages:
      </p>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Your notes will be well-organized and structured.</li>
      <li>
        The outlining method will make it easier for you to pay attention to the
        information you’re receiving.
      </li>
      <li>It also provides a handy framework for reviewing notes.</li>
